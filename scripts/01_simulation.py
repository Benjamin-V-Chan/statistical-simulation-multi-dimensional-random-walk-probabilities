"""
1. Import necessary modules (numpy, csv, os).
2. Define a function simulate_random_walk(dimension, num_steps):
    - Initialize current_position as a numpy array of zeros with length = dimension.
    - For each step from 1 to num_steps:
         - Randomly choose an axis (integer from 0 to dimension-1).
         - Randomly choose a step direction (+1 or -1).
         - Update the current_position along that axis.
         - If the updated position equals the origin (and not the initial step), immediately return True.
    - If no return to origin occurred during the steps, return False.
3. Define main():
    - Set simulation parameters:
         - A list of dimensions to simulate (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
         - The number of steps per simulation.
         - The number of trials per dimension.
    - Ensure the outputs directory exists.
    - Open (or create) a CSV file in the outputs directory to record the simulation results.
    - Write a header row (e.g., "dimension, trial, returned").
    - Loop over each dimension and each trial:
         - Run simulate_random_walk for the given dimension and steps.
         - Record the result (1 for True, 0 for False) along with the dimension and trial number.
4. Include the standard execution guard to run main().
