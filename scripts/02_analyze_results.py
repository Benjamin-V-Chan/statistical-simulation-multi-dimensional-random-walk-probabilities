"""
1. Import necessary modules (pandas, os).
2. Define main():
    - Read the simulation results CSV file from the outputs directory.
    - Group the data by dimension:
         - Count the total number of trials per dimension.
         - Sum the number of trials that returned to the origin.
         - Calculate the probability of return as (num_returns / total_trials).
    - Create a summary DataFrame with columns: dimension, num_trials, num_returns, probability.
    - Save the summary DataFrame to a new CSV file (e.g., "analysis_results.csv") in the outputs directory.
    - Optionally, print the summary to the console.
3. Include the standard execution guard to run main().
